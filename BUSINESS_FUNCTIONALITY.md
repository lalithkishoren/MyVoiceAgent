## Core Business Processes

### 1. Patient Onboarding Process

**Objective**: Efficiently collect and store patient information for first-time visitors

**Process Flow**:
```
New Patient Call → Information Collection → Verification → Data Storage → Service Provision
```

**Detailed Steps**:

1. **Initial Contact**
   - Patient calls hospital or accesses web interface
   - System greets with: "Hi! I'm Archana, your AI assistant from Renova Hospitals"
   - Language detection occurs automatically (English/Hindi/Telugu)

2. **Information Collection** (Required)
   - **Name**: Full patient name
   - **Phone**: Primary contact number (used as unique identifier)
   - **Email**: For appointment confirmations and communications
   - **Language Preference**: Automatically detected and stored

3. **Information Collection** (Optional/Contextual)
   - **Department**: Based on patient's medical needs
   - **Preferred Doctor**: If patient has a preference
   - **Medical History**: Brief summary if relevant
   - **Emergency Contact**: If requested

4. **Data Validation**
   - Phone number format validation
   - Email address format validation
   - Name completeness check
   - Duplicate prevention logic

5. **Storage & Registration**
   - Local session storage (immediate access)
   - Google Sheets persistent storage
   - Customer type marked as "new"
   - Timestamp recording for audit trail

**Business Rules**:
- Phone number is the primary unique identifier
- All communications follow patient's detected language
- Data must be stored in both local and cloud storage
- Patient consent is implicit through continued interaction

### 2. Returning Customer Recognition Process

**Objective**: Provide personalized experience for previous patients

**Process Flow**:
```
Phone Number Entry → Customer Detection → Data Retrieval → Personalized Greeting → Service
```

**Detection Mechanism**:

1. **Multi-Tier Detection System**:
   ```python
   # Tier 1: Current Session Memory
   if phone in patient_database:
       customer_type = "existing"  # Same session

   # Tier 2: Google Sheets Historical Data
   elif global_sheets_service.get_patient_by_phone(phone):
       customer_type = "returning"  # Previous visits

   # Tier 3: New Customer
   else:
       customer_type = "new"
   ```

2. **Personalized Responses**:
   - **Existing**: "I have your information from earlier in our conversation"
   - **Returning**: "Welcome back [Name]! I see you've visited us before. Would you like to book with [Previous Doctor] again?"
   - **New**: Standard information collection process

3. **Data Merge Process**:
   - Retrieve historical data from Google Sheets
   - Merge with current session information
   - Update visit count and last interaction timestamp
   - Maintain preference history

**Business Value**:
- Reduces information collection time by 60-80%
- Improves patient satisfaction through personalization
- Maintains continuity of care through doctor preferences
- Enables trend analysis for patient visits

2. **Existing Customer**
   - **Definition**: Customer with data in current session memory
   - **Characteristics**: Recently interacted within same session
   - **Process**: Reference existing data, update if needed
   - **Data Points**: Session-specific updates only

3. **Returning Customer**
   - **Definition**: Previous patient found in historical records
   - **Characteristics**: Has visited hospital before
   - **Process**: Merge historical data with current needs
   - **Data Points**: Visit history, preferences, previous doctors

### Customer Journey Mapping

#### First Visit Journey
```
Initial Contact → Language Detection → Information Collection →
Service Provision → Appointment Booking → Confirmation →
Data Storage → Follow-up Setup
```

#### Return Visit Journey
```
Initial Contact → Phone Recognition → Welcome Back Message →

## Appointment Management System

### Complete Appointment Booking Process

**Objective**: Efficiently schedule patient appointments while preventing conflicts

**Critical Business Flow**:
```
Patient Request → Information Gathering → Availability Check →
Conflict Resolution → Booking Confirmation → Multi-Channel Notification →
Calendar Integration → Record Logging
```

### Detailed Process Breakdown

#### Phase 1: Information Gathering
1. **Patient Demographics**
   - Name verification/collection
   - Phone number (customer detection trigger)
   - Email address for confirmations

2. **Appointment Requirements**
   - Preferred date (with relative date conversion)
   - Preferred time
   - Department/specialty needed
   - Doctor preference (if any)
   - Appointment type/reason

3. **Business Rules Applied**:
   - Convert relative dates ("tomorrow", "next week") to absolute dates (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Validate date is not in the past
   - Check for business hours compliance
   - Apply hospital operational calendar

#### Phase 2: Availability Verification

**Two-Step Booking Process** (Critical for preventing conflicts):

**Step 1: `check_appointment_availability()`**
```python
Function: check_appointment_availability
Input: date, time, duration (default 30 minutes)
Process:
  1. Query Google Calendar for existing appointments
  2. Check for time slot conflicts
  3. Apply business rules (working hours, holidays)
  4. Generate alternative slots if conflict exists
Output: Available/Not Available + Alternatives
```

**Business Logic**:
- Working hours: 9 AM to 6 PM (configurable)
- Weekend handling: Currently skip weekends (configurable)
- Conflict detection: 30-minute appointment blocks
- Alternative generation: Next 5 available slots within 7 days

**Step 2: `book_appointment()` - Only if Step 1 confirms availability**
```python
Function: book_appointment
Input: Patient data + appointment details
Process:
  1. Double-check availability (safety measure)
  2. Send email confirmation via Gmail API
  3. Create calendar event via Calendar API
  4. Log complete call record
  5. Update patient database
Output: Confirmation status + event IDs
```

### Appointment Cancellation Process

**Objective**: Allow patients to cancel appointments with proper verification

**Process Flow**:
```
Cancellation Request → Patient Verification → Appointment Search →
Verification Match → Calendar Removal → Email Notification → Record Update
```

**Verification Requirements**:
- Patient name
- Phone number
- Appointment date and time
- Doctor name
- Email verification (optional)

**Search & Match Logic**:
```python
# Search criteria with tolerance
time_tolerance = 15 minutes  # Allow small time discrepancies
name_match = patient_name.lower() in event.description
doctor_match = doctor_name.lower() in event.summary
time_match = abs(event_time - requested_time) <= time_tolerance
```

**Business Rules**:
- Cancellation allowed up to 2 hours before appointment
- Automatic email notification to patient
- Calendar event removal with audit trail
- No-show prevention through early cancellation incentive

### Alternative Slot Generation

**Algorithm**: Intelligent slot suggestion based on patient preferences

**Process**:
1. **Base Parameters**:
   - Start from requested date
   - Search window: 7 days forward
   - Time preferences: Same time if available, otherwise closest
   - Doctor availability: Consider if specified

2. **Ranking Criteria**:
   - Date proximity to original request
   - Time proximity to original request
   - Preferred doctor availability
   - Department resource availability

3. **Output Format**:
   ```python
   alternatives = [
       {
           'date': '2024-12-20',
           'time': '10:00 AM',
           'formatted': 'December 20, 2024 at 10:00 AM'
       }
   ]
   ```
